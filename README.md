Reactive-Bar-Chart-Demo
=======================

This is a simple Meteor app to demo a reactive D3JS bar chart.

Combined two examples for this demo:
 - The 'leaderboard' Meteor example
 - D3js bar-chart example from http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3885304

 - This fork was modified to eliminate the use of the SpaceBars language (& their templates) in favor of a more familiar d3.js way of presenting views. Now *everything* is written in html/css/js. This makes the code far more concise and eliminates the need of learning another templating language.

`meteor run` within the directory.
